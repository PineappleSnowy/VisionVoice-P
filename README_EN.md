## 🆚 Comparison with other products for blindness

### Google Blind Glasses vs 视界之声

- **👥 Inexpensive**:
  VisionVoice mainly uses common mobile phones to assist your life and guide you, you do not need to buy hardware separately. Although Google blind glasses are fully functional, they cost more than one thousand euros (about ten thousand yuan), and the price is high, most families can not afford it.
